# Project's Name: Irish Recipes

**About:** I have based my project on Recipes of Ireland. I plan to create a clear , easy and well structured web application so that 
people of all ages can find geart wholesome Irish Recipes. Users can also add their own recipes to the app and edit existing ones.

**Personal** reason  My personal reason for developing the web application is because of my grandmother. Over the years my grandmother 
has accumulated a lot of great recipes from family and friends. She stores them in an old tin in the kicthen and from time to time she 
lends some of her recipes out to people . Occasionally these great recipes never find their way back to the old tin and my grandmother 
has to under go the strenuous task of trying to located the recipe again. This process could take weeks even months to find and sometimes 
the recipe is lost because just like food people dont last forever. So i thought to myself why not add all these recipe to a 
mongo database and save my grandmother countless hours of searching . Not only would this be a great place to store the recipes it would 
also make it extremely easy to share them with family members overseas.

**Business opportunities:**

# Design

**Theme**
I got my inspiration for my theme from a mini project i did with the *Code Institute*. The mini project was 
thorin and company and in this project they used a bootstrap theme called **Clean Blog**. While using this theme 
in the mini project i found it to be very clear, well structured and easy to navigate. For these reasons i decided 
to use it for my Irish Recipes web application. One major deciding factor for choosing this theme was it was the
only free multi page design on the bootstrap site that i liked. I used a theme because it speeds up the design Process
and leaves less room for errors and display problems. 

**Logo**
For my logo i choose a picture of the *Cliffs Of Moher*. Not only is it one of Irelands most popular and beautiful land marks
, i thing its perfect for the web application because it has the sea(fish recipes) and land (Meat, Vegan recipes) in it. I know 
its a weird way to pick a logo but it makes scene to me.
